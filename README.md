## About <a name = "about"></a>

Grading or marking student the answer sheet is a very common thing of teacher after the student test. However, this one costs a lot of time depend on the number of students that teacher teach and easily to make mistake when manual grading . Understanding these concerns, one of solution has been developed that is Optical Mark Recognition.
This solution is just suitable with multiple choice question test which requires student to highlight the one or more the correct options (A, B, C, D). Besides, in real life, we have a typical kind of test that is short answer. To deal with such kind of test, we propose a AI system which can scan the answer sheet then extracting exactly the handwriting information, content in each answer box correspond with question number of the test based on a defined format answer sheets. After that, the extracted content will be compared string by string with a "True Answers" file, input by user.
